# Now Playing for Twitter & Spotify
*Daniel McKenzie*

Python script to do useful things with the current song you're listening to on Spotify.

Currently it does the following:

* Send a [tweet](https://twitter.com/mckenziejnow) to Twitter (#NowPlaying `Song Name` by `Artist Name`)
* Update your Twitter Profile & Banner image
* Add current song to a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/djmshire/playlist/4yxCIRtkaD00xEwDZzp6En)
* Add current song into a SQLite database
  > Plan to do useful things with this in the future
